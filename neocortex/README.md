Adapted from https://stackabuse.com/git-adding-a-commit-message/

When viewing a repository on GitHub, you have probably noticed the messages next to a file or folder:

![git commit messages in github](https://stackabuse.s3.amazonaws.com/media/git-adding-commit-message-1.png)


These messages are added to the repository at the time in which you make the commit, and are not file/folder descriptions, as it might seem at first glance. 

They are simply notes that were made when commiting (saving) changes to the code repository at the last time that file/folder was updated.

In GitHub, the message next to the file or folder is from the last commit in which that file/folder changed. So these are not all necessarily from the last commit. Otherwise it wouldn't be very useful if GitHub displayed the same commit message from the last commit for all files.
